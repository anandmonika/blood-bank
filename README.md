# Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.5.

## Tasks
- [x] Get initial blood group bottle counts from the user to initiate the app
- [x] Get the receiver blood group and highlight the donor blood groups
- [ ] ~~Get the receiver requirement bottles and allow drag and drop to fulfill the requirement~~

I was not able to complete the last task due to multiple reasons, my sincere apologies. However, I've submitted the complete top two tasks and it's hosted here for your review: https://blood-bank-sandy.vercel.app/.

I hope you will review my submission and give me a chance to move forward, looking forward to hearing from you.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
